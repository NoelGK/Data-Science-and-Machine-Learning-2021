Project 2 for Machine Learning autum 2021.
Files "neural.py", "aux_funcs.py", "logistic.py" contain the necessary classes and functions to use my own designed neural network and logistic regression.
The file "test.py" shows an example of how to use each one of them.
Lastly, the jupyter notebook is where all the calculations for the final report where done.
