In this directory you can find all the python scripts related to the development of both a deep convolutional denoising autoencoder and a variational autoencoder. There are also aviable the scripts dedicated to the addition of white noise to the original audios and all the preprocessing stage, including conversion to logaritmoc spectrogram and split into train and test.

For the source code of an Autoencoder: autoencoder.py
"    "    "     "    "  " Variational Autoencoder: new_vae.py
For the preprocessing elements: preprocess.py
For adding noise: add_noise.py
